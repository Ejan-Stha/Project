**Note:** Do not flash another ISO file after flashing Ventoy.iso file from balenEthcher. After flashing ventoy.iso file, the drive Is unreadable, and we cannot copy other ISO file into the drive. For this, we need to boot the ventoy,iso into the system and install, after installation, we can remove the drive and it will be readable and we can easily drag and drop ISO file inside the drive.
