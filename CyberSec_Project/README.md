## Task 3. View Your Computer Information

The details of my computer are shown from screenshot below:-

![Storage](./images/Week-1_Task-2_Hardisk_Screenshot.PNG)

As you can see from above screenshot:

**Data Storage Specification** :- 580.51 GB (used), 361.61 GB (Free)

![Specification of RAM, OS & Processor](./images/Week-1_Task-2_RAM&osversion&Processor_Screenshot.PNG)

As you can see from above screenshot:

**CPU Specification** :- Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10500 CPU @ 3.10 GHz

**OS Specification** :- 10.0.19045 version

**RAM Specification** :- 16880955392 byte

## Task 4. Deploy Linux Web Server in VirtualBox

![Kernal version & boot manager](./images/Folder-location_&_Kernal-Version.PNG)

The boot manager used in openWRT is U-Boot which is also known as Universal Bootloader and the kernel used in openWRT is grub as you can seen in above screenshot.

**According to me**: -

VirtualBox is a virtual platform and open-source software which helps to create an environment for other operating system through virtual machines on host operating system. for example, if you have installed VirtualBox in windows then you can add other operating system above windows such as Linux OS, Mac OS, Windows and many more.

OpenWRT is a Linux based operating system which has a minimum use of storage and maximum capacity to be used in networking field where it can used for basic study purpose and can be used in real time world.

**According to research or chatGPT**: -

VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows users to create and run virtual machines on their host operating system. VirtualBox supports a variety of guest operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and others.

OpenWrt is a Linux-based open-source operating system designed for embedded devices, particularly networking equipment such as routers, access points, and residential gateways. It is a flexible and extensible platform that allows users to replace the manufacturer's firmware on their networking devices with a customizable and feature-rich alternative.

**Difference**: -

ChatGPT explains details about "developed by oracle" whereas I haven’t clearly explained. similarly, chatGPT has explained that it supports variety of operating system and can be created and run in virtual machines on host operating system, but I have clearly explained that by giving example of window user.

ChatGPT explains that openwrt is an open-source operating system that it is used in embedded devices which uses in networking equipment’s like routers, access point and residential, however I have explained that it is a Linux based software used in networking field which can used by students for study purpose and can be used in real time world.



## Task 5. Browse to OpenWRT Websites
